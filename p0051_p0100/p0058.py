'''
Starting from the center, the diagonals are the four corners of a sqaure, and in
crement by 2n.
The center point is a 1x1 square, the next is a 2x2, and so on. Thus, the corners of a 4x4
square would increment by 2x4 = 8, and the diagonals would follow a pattern of
1,    3,5,7,9,    13,17,21,25,       31,37,43,49,     57,65,73,81, ...
