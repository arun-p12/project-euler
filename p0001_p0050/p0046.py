'''
The smallest odd composite number that cannot be represented as the sum of a prime
and twice a square. E.g. 9 = 7 + 2(1**2) ; 27 = 19 + 2(2**2)

Originally had maintained the list of 2x^2; and then check if for every i, if
the (odd_composite - i) is in that lis. This logic took about 7s to execute.

Modified logic to compute the value of x, and if it is an integer value. [[ from OC = P + 2x^2 ]]
This reduced the execution time to 100ms!!!
