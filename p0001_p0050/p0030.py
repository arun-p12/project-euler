1634 = 1**4 + 6**4 + 3**4 + 4**4
What is the sum of ALL numbers that can be represented as the sum of the 5th power of its digits

Since 9**5 = 59,049, a
   - 3-digit number can result upto 177,147,    (999)
   - 4-digit number can result upto 236,196,    (9,999)
   - 5-digit number can result upto 295,245,    (99,999)
   - 6-digit number can result upto 354,294     (999,999)
Thus, we know the upper bound of the solution is a 6-digit number.
Futher filteration helps set the upper bound to 399,999  (sum = 295488)
