49/98 = 1/2 ... which is the same as 4/8, if we cancel off the 9.
There are 4 such 2-digit examples (if we ignore trivial examples such as 30/50 and 12/12)

Take three digits A, B, and C. Now check AB/BC and AB/CB. Check if this fraction equals A/C
Examples:
    . digits are 1, 1, and 2        :: 11/12 or 11/21  must equal 1/2 (false)
    . digits 2, 3, and 3            :: 23/33           must equal 2/3 (false)
    . digits 1, 6, and 4            :: 16/64 or 16/46  must equal 1/4 (true)
