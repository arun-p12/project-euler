In 1406357289 (a 0 to 9 pandigital number), 406 (digits 2, 3, and 4) is divisible by 2.
063 (digits 3, 4, and 5) is divisible by 3, 635 (digits 4, 5, 6) is divisible by 5, etc.
The last set, 289 (digits 8, 9, and 10) is divisible by 17.

To find the sum of all 0-9 pandigital numbers with this property.
