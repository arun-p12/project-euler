28 =  1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, the sum of its proper divisors. This is a perfect number.

A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called
abundant if this sum exceeds n. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12 ; thus 12 is the smallest abundant #

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant #s.
Note: all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
