'''
3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously
remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7.
Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and
right to left. NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

'''
Correct implementation of truncating number string, from left and right.
1234 returns [1234, 234, 34, 4, 123, 12, 1]

Rather slow, since each number is explicitly checked.
