7254 = 39 x 186, where the multiplicand, the multiplier, and the product combine to make a

'''
Since the required set is 1-9 pandigital, a zero should not be contained in the multiplicand, 
the multiplier, or the product. Additionally, all digits must be different. There are only
two combinations i) a 1-digit number multipled by a 4-digit number resulting in a 4-digit
product ii) a 2-digit number multipled by a 3-digit number resulting in a 4-digit
product.
