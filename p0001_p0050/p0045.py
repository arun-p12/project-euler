'''
Numbers that are triangular [ n(n+1)/2 ], pentagonal [ n(3n -1/2 ], and hexagonal [ n(2n -1) ]

rather than creating three lists, and comparing if an element is in each of them, we can reduce
the problem space by:
    - ignoring the triangular list, since every element in it, will also be in the hex list
    - take the hex_list, and solve for P using the pent_list (could do the reverse too)
            . P = (3n^2 - n) / 2 =>  3n^2 -n -2P = 0 ; now solve for integer value of n
